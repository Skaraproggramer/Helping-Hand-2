					A friend of mine had a mother that was really close to a GSP adviser which resulted in her joining the GSP out of the request of her mother. She started being in the GSP when she was grade 7 but she really haven’t fully committed herself to this club then. But after every meeting that happened on Wednesday, she was inspired by the advocacies that the GSP upholds. 
					<br><br>
					Although she was a shy person then, she said that really enjoyed the experience of having to meeting new people and creating friendships and acquaintances even though she had a hard time answering simple questions because of her shyness. The higher ups saw the untapped potential that she can release and long story short, she received the highest award of Chief Girl Scout, she also became one of the representatives of the Philippines in an event held on Korea, representative of the Davao del Norte in the National Gathering of Girl Scouts, National Youth Leaders’ Summit, Regional Outstanding Girl, President of the GSP of her local school and many more.

					When I was in Junior high, I joined the BSP because my friends also wanted to join. We would line up in every Monday, Wednesday and Friday of the week, practicing drills and having the older ones teaching us the basics and the people we needed to know. The experience made me more practical in everyday life, using things in creative ways that we never knew we could.

					One of the fun part of scouting happens after camps, when you can tell your friends who fell into the canal and who got punished. To share experiences that some never had the chance to and to find more aspiring scouts as you spread your story of scouting.

					Sitting by the bonfire, looking at the wonder of nature, the night sky, and feeling the cold breeze. I've felt as if I was where I belong, away from city lights, laughing along with fellow scouts. The essence of scouting, is to not to be blind to the beauty of nature.

					We stayed up all night for a rover vigil, looking out for our stick that we should never lose. We saw other scouts asking other aspiring rover scouts if they can borrow their sticks. As the sun arose, we saw the scouts again carrying on their shoulders a lot of sticks. We ran away, it was a good time.
