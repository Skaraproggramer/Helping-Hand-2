						Making good mates is important, but sometimes trying to fit in with a group can turn sour. 
						Giving in to pressure from your friends to do something you normally wouldn't do can leave 
						you feeling guilty, regretful, ashamed, embarrassed or even frightened. Find out what peer 
						pressure is and how to handle it, including what to do if things get serious.
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='9'><b>What is Peer Pressure? </b></font>
						
						<br><br><font size = "5">
						Wanting to feel part of something can put pressure on you to act in certain ways. 
						If you’re doing something you wouldn’t normally do, or are not doing something you’d like 
						to do, simply so that you’ll be accepted by the people you hang out with, you’re suffering from peer pressure.
						<br><br>
						
						Peer pressure can influence:
						<ul><br>
							<li>the way you dress of wear your hair
							<li>the activities you get involved in
							<li>the music you listen to
							<li>your decisions about using drugs and alcohol
							<li>who you date
							<li>who you’re friends with.
						</ul>
						<br>
						
						The pressure to act in a certain way can be:
						<ul><br>
							<li>direct: someone telling you what you should be doing
							<li>indirect: your group of friends might do certain activities together that you’re 
							unlikely to do outside of that group
							<li>self-motivated: putting pressure on yourself to fit in with your friendship group, 
							because of certain standards they’ve set or comments they’ve made.
						</ul>
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='9'><b>How to deal with peer pressure</b></font><br><br>
						Peer pressure isn’t always a bad thing; sometimes it can be good, such as when your friends stop you 
						from doing something dumb that you’ll later regret. But often peer pressure can be linked to negative stuff. 
						Check out the following examples of peer pressure and consider some tips for dealing with them.
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Pressure to bully</b></font><br><br>
						Seeing friends bullying others in person or online (cyberbullying) can make you feel pressured to get involved. 
						It might seem okay at the time, but later you feel embarrassed, guilty or ashamed.
						<br>
						
						<ul><br>
							<li>Think about why your friends had such a strong influence on your actions. Was this a way for you to gain self-confidence?
							<li>Did you feel that if you didn't join in, your friends would start to bully you?
							<li>Reflect on whether your friends are having a negative impact on you.
							<li>Don't label yourself a 'bully'. We all make mistakes, but they don’t have to permanently define us.
							<li>Aim to develop a stronger sense of your own values and to stop bullying.
						</ul>
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Pressure to diet or body-build</b></font>
						<br><br>
						If your friends have strict diet or workout regimens, you might feel like you also need to achieve the ‘perfect’ body. 
						But worrying about your body image can leave you feeling burned out and stressed about how you look. Are you bored with 
						calculating the nutritional value of everything you eat? Are your workouts feeling lacklustre, because you’d rather be 
						doing something else? If you recognise yourself in these scenarios, maybe you’re dieting or working out just to fit in with your mates.
						<br>
						
						<ul><br>
							<li>Focus on nourishing your body by engaging in stuff that you enjoy and that empowers you, such as singing, acting or volunteering.
							<li>Spend time with supportive mates and family.
							<li>See a health professional to learn ways of developing a positive body image.
							<li>Remember that no one should pressure you to change the way your body looks; your confidence in your own body is the only thing that matters!
						</ul>
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Pressure to diet or body-build</b></font>
						<br><br>
						If you've felt pressured into drinking or taking drugs, you might feel guilt and regret afterwards for ‘giving in’.
						<br>
						
						<ul><br>
							<li>Talk to a family member or a trusted friend.
							<li>See a counsellor or health professional.
							<li>Remember that many people of your age have sought help, too.
						</ul>
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Pressure to have sex</b></font>
						<br><br>
						You might feel pressured to have sex if you’re afraid of what your partner or friends will think if you don’t and if 
						you want to fit in. But sex is intimate and very personal, and you may feel vulnerable afterwards.
						<br>
						
						<ul><br>
							<li>You may not have trusted your partner yet or felt emotionally prepared. It’s ok to tell your partner that you’re not ready and expect them to respect that.
							<li>Many people later regret giving in to pressure to have sex. If it happens to you, don’t label or blame yourself.
							<li>Learning from this experience and understanding your feelings around it will help you to make better decisions in the future.
						</ul>
						<br>
						If you've been pressured into having sex without expressing your consent, remember that sexual assault is 
						never okay and that there are support services available.
						<br><br>

						<font size='9'><b>Some ways to handle peer pressure</b></font>
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Pursue your own interests</b></font>
						<br><br>
						Hang out with people who like doing the same stuff you do.
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Say "no"</b></font>
						<br><br>
						If you can calmly explain why something‘s not for you, you’ll gain respect.
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Don't Judge</b></font>
						<br><br>
						Respecting someone else’s choice may help them respect yours.
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='6'><b>Friends don't have to agree with everything</b></font>
						<br><br>
						Understanding that everyone has their own opinion means you can chill out and feel less defensive.
						<br><br>
						
						<font size='9'><b>What to do if things get serious</b></font>
						<br><br>
						
						If you’re in a situation where you feel threatened, are being hurt, or feel pressured into doing
						something that you’re really uncomfortable with, you need to get help. Tell a family member, a friend 
						from outside the situation, a teacher or a counsellor.
